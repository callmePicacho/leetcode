## 思路

拆分 SQL

先找到部门最高的工资：

```mysql
SELECT
	DepartmentId,
	max( Salary ) 
FROM
	employee 
GROUP BY
	DepartmentId;
```

再找到部门对应的部门名：

```mysql
SELECT
	department.`Name` 
FROM
	Employee,
	Department 
WHERE
	Department.Id = Employee.DepartmentId;
```

最后，部门最高工资和部门号作为子查询，补全其他信息得到结果

## 代码

```mysql
SELECT
	department.`Name` AS Department,
	Employee.`Name` AS Employee,
	Salary 
FROM
	Employee,
	Department 
WHERE
	Department.Id = Employee.DepartmentId 
	AND ( DepartmentId, Salary ) IN (
	SELECT
		DepartmentId,
		max( Salary ) 
	FROM
		employee 
GROUP BY
	DepartmentId)
```
